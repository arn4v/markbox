# Bookmarky

Bookmarky is an open-source bookmarking app inspired by [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) built with React, Next.js, TailwindCSS & Firebase.

## Why build another bookmarking tool?

I tried out Pinboard, it's a great tool and when they say it's fast, they mean it but I decided I care about a great user interface just as much as I care about speed and started building Bookmarky to address my needs.

A few use cases I want to solve are:

- API for automation.
- Drag and drop newsletter schedule builder (like [Mailbrew](https://mailbrew.com))
- Integration with Roam Research.
